# WebAppMaker
WebApp Maker make web apps (Duh). It is open source and make with python and shell.</br> This app can take any website and turn it into an app.</br> I highly recommend turning these few websites into webapps:</br> - Krunker.io (Fps Game)</br> - play.fancade.com (Minigame Arcade)</br> - Your Own Website If You Have One Apart from that enjoy my app</br></br>  By 220735540 (a.k.a RP400)
